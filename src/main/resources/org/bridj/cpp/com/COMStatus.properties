C0262515=ERROR_GRAPHICS_OPM_OUTPUT_DOES_NOT_SUPPORT_CGMSA: The video output cannot enable the Content Generation Management System Analog (CGMS-A) protection technology because it does not support it.
C0262516=ERROR_GRAPHICS_OPM_HDCP_SRM_NEVER_SET: IOPMVideoOutput's GetInformation() method cannot return the version of the SRM being used because the application never successfully passed an SRM to the video output.
C0262517=ERROR_GRAPHICS_OPM_RESOLUTION_TOO_HIGH: IOPMVideoOutput's Configure() method cannot enable the specified output protection technology because the output's screen resolution is too high.
C0262518=ERROR_GRAPHICS_OPM_ALL_HDCP_HARDWARE_ALREADY_IN_USE: IOPMVideoOutput's Configure() method cannot enable HDCP because the display adapter's HDCP hardware is already being used by other physical outputs.
C0262519=ERROR_GRAPHICS_OPM_VIDEO_OUTPUT_NO_LONGER_EXISTS: The operating system asynchronously destroyed this OPM video output because the operating system's state changed. This error typically occurs because the monitor physical device object (PDO) associated with this video output was removed, the monitor PDO associated with this video output was stopped, the video output's session became a nonconsole session or the video output's desktop became an inactive desktop.
C026251A=ERROR_GRAPHICS_OPM_SESSION_TYPE_CHANGE_IN_PROGRESS: IOPMVideoOutput's methods cannot be called when a session is changing its type. There are currently three types of sessions: console, disconnected and remote (remote desktop protocol [RDP] or Independent Computing Architecture [ICA]).
C0262580=ERROR_GRAPHICS_I2C_NOT_SUPPORTED: The monitor connected to the specified video output does not have an I2C bus.
C0262581=ERROR_GRAPHICS_I2C_DEVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST: No device on the I2C bus has the specified address.
C0262582=ERROR_GRAPHICS_I2C_ERROR_TRANSMITTING_DATA: An error occurred while transmitting data to the device on the I2C bus.
C0262583=ERROR_GRAPHICS_I2C_ERROR_RECEIVING_DATA: An error occurred while receiving data from the device on the I2C bus.
C0262584=ERROR_GRAPHICS_DDCCI_VCP_NOT_SUPPORTED: The monitor does not support the specified Virtual Control Panel (VCP) code.
C0262585=ERROR_GRAPHICS_DDCCI_INVALID_DATA: The data received from the monitor is invalid.
C0262586=ERROR_GRAPHICS_DDCCI_MONITOR_RETURNED_INVALID_TIMING_STATUS_BYTE: A function call failed because a monitor returned an invalid Timing Status byte when the operating system used the Display Data Channel Command Interface (DDC/CI) Get Timing Report and Timing Message command to get a timing report from a monitor.
C0262587=ERROR_GRAPHICS_MCA_INVALID_CAPABILITIES_STRING: The monitor returned a DDC/CI capabilities string that did not comply with the ACCESS.bus 3.0, DDC/CI 1.1 or MCCS 2 Revision 1 specification.
C0262588=ERROR_GRAPHICS_MCA_INTERNAL_ERROR: An internal Monitor Configuration API error occurred.
C0262589=ERROR_GRAPHICS_DDCCI_INVALID_MESSAGE_COMMAND: An operation failed because a DDC/CI message had an invalid value in its command field.
C026258A=ERROR_GRAPHICS_DDCCI_INVALID_MESSAGE_LENGTH: This error occurred because a DDC/CI message length field contained an invalid value.
C026258B=ERROR_GRAPHICS_DDCCI_INVALID_MESSAGE_CHECKSUM: This error occurred because the value in a DDC/CI message checksum field did not match the message's computed checksum value. This error implies that the data was corrupted while it was being transmitted from a monitor to a computer.
C02625D6=ERROR_GRAPHICS_PMEA_INVALID_MONITOR: The HMONITOR no longer exists, is not attached to the desktop, or corresponds to a mirroring device.
C02625D7=ERROR_GRAPHICS_PMEA_INVALID_D3D_DEVICE: The Direct3D (D3D) device's GDI display device no longer exists, is not attached to the desktop, or is a mirroring display device.
C02625D8=ERROR_GRAPHICS_DDCCI_CURRENT_CURRENT_VALUE_GREATER_THAN_MAXIMUM_VALUE: A continuous VCP code's current value is greater than its maximum value. This error code indicates that a monitor returned an invalid value.
C02625D9=ERROR_GRAPHICS_MCA_INVALID_VCP_VERSION: The monitor's VCP Version (0xDF) VCP code returned an invalid version value.
C02625DA=ERROR_GRAPHICS_MCA_MONITOR_VIOLATES_MCCS_SPECIFICATION: The monitor does not comply with the Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS) specification it claims to support.
C02625DB=ERROR_GRAPHICS_MCA_MCCS_VERSION_MISMATCH: The MCCS version in a monitor's mccs_ver capability does not match the MCCS version the monitor reports when the VCP Version (0xDF) VCP code is used.
C02625DC=ERROR_GRAPHICS_MCA_UNSUPPORTED_MCCS_VERSION: The Monitor Configuration API only works with monitors that support the MCCS 1.0 specification, the MCCS 2.0 specification, or the MCCS 2.0 Revision 1 specification.
C02625DE=ERROR_GRAPHICS_MCA_INVALID_TECHNOLOGY_TYPE_RETURNED: The monitor returned an invalid monitor technology type. CRT, plasma, and LCD (TFT) are examples of monitor technology types. This error implies that the monitor violated the MCCS 2.0 or MCCS 2.0 Revision 1 specification.
C02625DF=ERROR_GRAPHICS_MCA_UNSUPPORTED_COLOR_TEMPERATURE: The SetMonitorColorTemperature() caller passed a color temperature to it that the current monitor did not support. CRT, plasma, and LCD (TFT) are examples of monitor technology types. This error implies that the monitor violated the MCCS 2.0 or MCCS 2.0 Revision 1 specification.
C02625E0=ERROR_GRAPHICS_ONLY_CONSOLE_SESSION_SUPPORTED: This function can be used only if a program is running in the local console session. It cannot be used if the program is running on a remote desktop session or on a terminal server session.
